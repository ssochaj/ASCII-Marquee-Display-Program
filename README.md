# ASCII Marquee Display-Program
Welcome to the McMaster Marquee Display project! ðŸš€

# Key Features
* __Interactive Animation:__ The program allows users to interact with the marquee display, adding characters to the animation with each keystroke.
* __Smooth Animation:__ The marquee display smoothly shifts characters across the screen, creating an eye-catching and engaging visual experience.
* __User-Friendly:__ With a clean and easy-to-understand interface, users can enjoy the marquee display without any technical hassle.

# How It Works
The project employs a program loop that consists of initialization, logic, and drawing routines. The marquee display logic calculates the position of characters in the animation, allowing for smooth and dynamic movement. Thanks to clever index wraparound calculations, the animation gracefully loops, ensuring the characters keep flowing.

Enjoy the McMaster Marquee Display and have fun exploring the world of interactive terminal animations! ðŸŽ‰
